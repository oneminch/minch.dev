## What

PlayTales is a full-stack ecommerce store for purchasing story-driven games.

## Why

I built this project to further solidify my knowledge of full-stack web development. I wanted to demonstrate my ability to design and implement a complete web application, from the UI to the database. It required a strong understanding of various programming languages, frameworks, and tools, as well as the ability to integrate them seamlessly.

Here are some of the concepts and patterns I have learned:

- Pagination (UI & API)
- Token-based Authentication
- Secure User Session Management
- Data Modelling
- Complex State Management using Context API
- Queries and Mutations

## How

I was already comfortable building frontend interfaces using different tools, so I ended up using React, and Tailwind CSS to build a dynamic UI. The main challenge for me was building a complete backend from scratch and integrating it with the frontend. I used Express (Node.js) to create endpoints that handle different tasks such as product searching and user authentication. I designed a Postgres database schema using Prisma and used its client in the different Express endpoints to build type-safe queries. I also implemented user authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and cookies.

I used other libraries from the React ecosystem for client-side actions: React Router for routing & Tanstack Query for data fetching.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: `React`, `TypeScript`, `Tailwind CSS`, `React Router`, `Tanstack Query`,
- **Backend**: `Node`, `Express`, `Postgres`, `Prisma`
- **Deployment**: `Render`
