## What is Bentolio?

Bentolio is a minimal portfolio template built with Astro, Tailwind CSS & GSAP.

## Why Did You Build It?

As a curious person, I like tinkering with some tools to see how they solve a particular problem in software development, and I keep a list of technologies and tools I want to experiment with. This minimal portfolio template is an experiment using two tools from that list: the Astro web framework and the GSAP animation tool. The design is hugely inspired by [@TomIsLoading](https://twitter.com/TomIsLoading)'s Bento Grid from [Hover.dev](https://hover.dev).

## How Did You Build It?

I basically implemented [@TomIsLoading](https://twitter.com/TomIsLoading)'s Bento Grid design from [Hover.dev](https://hover.dev) using Astro as the web framework. I used Tailwind CSS for styling and GSAP to animate parts of the page on load.
