## What is EncryptedList?

EncryptedList is a passion project I built to catalog software tools that are secure by default. This is my first major Vue project, and as of 2024, it receives thousands of regular visits.

## Why Did You Build It?

I'm interested in tools that are private and secure by design, so I wanted to build a full-stack website to catalog software services that are secure by default where people can discover and share tools that enhance their digital privacy.

## How Did You Build It?

Everything about [EncryptedList 1.0](https://oneminch.github.io/EncryptedList-v1/) was static. I created a simple HTML & CSS page with a couple of dropdowns for filtering items. I used a flat JSON file to store the data and vanilla JavaScript to fetch the contents of this file to render them on the page. Managing data in a static JSON file was tedious, and this led to the development of the second version.

[EncryptedList 2.0](https://encryptedlist.xyz/) is an SPA that uses Vue.js for the UI and Airtable for data. I created serverless functions on Vercel to connect the UI with the Airtable database. To make the web app complete, I implemented client-side search and filtering along with a submission page for new tools powered by GitHub Issues.

> Due to most logic being done on the client-side, this version of the project has some performance issues. I plan to fix those issues by following modern best practices, and introduce new features in the next major version of the project.

EncryptedList 3.0 is currently a work in progress. In addition to performance improvements, I'm working on adding new features that improve the user experience such as pagination, optimized search and sorting, and features suggested by users such as multi-tag filtering.

## What Tools Did You Use?

- **Frontend**: `Vue`, `Vue Router`, `VueX`
- **Backend**: `Airtable`, `Serverless Functions`
- **Deployment**: `Vercel`
