## What is Formend?

Formend is a serverless backend I built to help me handle form submissions.

## Why Did You Build It?

I have used several form endpoint tools to handle form submissions for my portfolio and side-projects. Even though these tools are convenient to set up and use, they are not customizable to the developer's needs (at least not for free 👀). I built Formend as a flexible and customizable alternative to other form handling solutions.

## How Did You Build It?

I used Flask to create a serverless backend that interacts with a Postgres database. A form submission to any configured endpoint on Formend is stored to a database table dynamically created for that endpoint. After the form data is stored, an email notification with the form body is sent to a pre-configured email address. The project is deployed on the Vercel platform.

## What Tools Did You Use?

- **Framework**: `Flask (Python)`
- **Database**: `PostgreSQL`
- **Deployment**: `Vercel`
