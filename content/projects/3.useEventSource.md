## What is `useEventSource`?

`useEventSource` is a Vue composable for simplifying Server-Sent Events (SSE).

It is based on the standard `EventSource` interface, and makes working with SSEs simpler in Vue & Nuxt applications.

```bash
npm i @minch/use-event-source
```

## Why Did You Build It?

When working on apps which involve streaming data from the server to a client, the `EventSource` API is an important part of that workflow in the client. I was working on a Gen AI app which needed to handle responses streamed to the browser. I implemented the functionality inside my Vue components which I eventually extracted into a composable and published as an NPM package.

## What Tools Did You Use?

- **Language**: `TypeScript`, `Vue`, `Nuxt`
