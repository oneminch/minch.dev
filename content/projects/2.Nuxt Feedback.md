## What is Nuxt Feedback?

Nuxt Feedback is a customizable feedback widget for Nuxt apps.

```bash
npm i @minch/nuxt-feedback
```

## Why Did You Build It?

I wanted to create a simple way to collect user feedback for Nuxt apps and sites without relying on heavy third-party services or complex integrations. I wanted to create a lightweight, customizable solution that developers could easily drop into their Nuxt applications. The goal was to build something that was both developer-friendly and provided a smooth user experience for collecting feedback.

## How Did You Build It?

I built Nuxt Feedback as a Nuxt module that provides a customizable feedback widget component. The module is designed to be plug-and-play - developers can install it via npm and configure it through their Nuxt config file.

The widget itself is built using Shadcn-Vue components and Tailwind CSS for a consistent, accessible UI that can be easily themed.

For feedback submission, I implemented multiple delivery methods including email integration through Resend and GitHub Issues integration, giving developers flexibility in how they want to handle incoming feedback. The module also supports custom submission endpoints for developers who want to integrate with their own backend systems.

## What Tools Did You Use?

- **Frontend**: `Nuxt`, `Shadcn-Vue`
- **Styling**: `Tailwind CSS`
- **Methods**: `Resend`, `GitHub`
